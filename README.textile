RailsLayout is a utility gem you can use during development to set up a default application layout with partials for Rails flash messages and navigation links. It is a Rails generator that you add to your Rails application Gemfile.

You can generate layout files suitable for use with the following front-end frameworks:

* @simple@ - simple layout
* @bootstrap2@ - Twitter Bootstrap 2.3
* @bootstrap3@ - Twitter Bootstrap 3.0
* (more to come)

The RailsLayout gem generates application layout files:

* app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
* app/views/layouts/_messages.html.erb
* app/views/layouts/_navigation.html.erb

Additionally, when the @simple@ option is selected:

  * app/assets/stylesheets/simple.css
