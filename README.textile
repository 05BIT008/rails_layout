h1. !http://railsapps.github.io/images/rails-36x36.jpg(RailsLayout Gem)! RailsLayout Gem

RailsLayout is a utility gem to use during development to set up a default application layout with partials for Rails flash messages and navigation links. It is a Rails generator that you add to your Rails application Gemfile.

h4. Supported Frameworks

You can generate layout files suitable for use with the following front-end frameworks:

* @simple@ - simple layout
* @bootstrap2@ - Twitter Bootstrap 2.3
* @bootstrap3@ - Twitter Bootstrap 3.0
* @foundation4@ - Zurb Foundation 4.0

h4. Generated Files

The RailsLayout gem generates application layout files:

* app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
* app/views/layouts/_messages.html.erb
* app/views/layouts/_navigation.html.erb

Additionally, when the @simple@ option is selected:

* app/assets/stylesheets/simple.css

h4. Support for ERB or Haml

If you are using ERB for Rails views, the RailsLayout gem will generate ERB files (as shown above).

If you are using Haml, the RailsLayout gem will generate Haml files instead.

h2. Usage Example

To see how the RailsLayout gem is used in an application, see the "Learn Rails":https://github.com/RailsApps/learn-rails example application that is described in the book "Learn Ruby on Rails":http://learn-rails.com/learn-ruby-on-rails.html.
